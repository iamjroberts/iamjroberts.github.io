## About
Hi John here! As a seasoned Mechanical Design Engineer at [RingIR](https://ring-ir.com/),  I specialize in the intricate design of optical layouts for mid-infrared spectrometers, demonstrating proficiency in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools. My role involves translating conceptual ideas into practical, cutting-edge solutions for complex optical systems. I lead the seamless integration of electrical, optical, and mechanical systems into cohesive and functional spectrometer devices.

- B.S., Mechanical Engineering Technology | New Mexico State University (_May 2018_)

## Work Experience
**Mechanical Design Engineer @ Ring IR Inc. (_August 2018 - Present_)**
- Uncovered and corrected missing step in production data pipeline which impacted over 70% of active accounts
- Redeveloped loan originations model which resulted in 50% improvement in model performance and saving 1 million dollars in potential losses

**Data Science Consultant @ Shawhin Talebi Ventures LLC (_December 2020 - Present_)**
- Conducted data collection, processing, and analysis for novel study evaluating the impact of over 300 biometrics variables on human performance in hyper-realistic, live-fire training scenarios
- Applied unsupervised deep learning approaches to longitudinal ICU data to discover novel sepsis sub-phenotypes

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees


Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.



### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales


Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
