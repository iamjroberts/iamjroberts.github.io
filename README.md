# My Digital Billboard

## About
As Lead Mechanical Design Engineer for 6 years at [RingIR](https://ring-ir.com/), I ensure cross functionality of electrical, optical, and mechanical systems into cohesive and reliable mid-infrared spectrometer devices. I specialize in the design and alignment of complex optical layouts.

With an unwavering love for CAD work and an insatiable appetite for new challenges, I can't get enough when it comes to mechanical design. Whether it's intricate components or conceptualizing innovative solutions, I approach each task with enthusiasm and a can-do attitude. The thrill of problem-solving and continuous learning is like fuel to me. I have the drive to do the leg work and research necessary to translate conceptual ideas into tangible designs. I am eager for collaboration, always open to feedback, and ready to teach or learn from others. 

Outside of my career I love spending time with my children and working on my home. As a jack of all trades I enjoy operating heavy equiptment, welding, wood working and renovation projects. Getting out to explore the known and unknown locations in the beautiful state of New Mexico has been my newest project.

## Work Experience
**Mechanical Design Engineer @ Ring IR Inc. (_August 2018 - Present_)**
- Uncovered and corrected missing step in production data pipeline which impacted over 70% of active accounts
- Redeveloped loan originations model which resulted in 50% improvement in model performance and saving 1 million dollars in potential losses

**Data Science Consultant @ Shawhin Talebi Ventures LLC (_December 2020 - Present_)**
- Conducted data collection, processing, and analysis for novel study evaluating the impact of over 300 biometrics variables on human performance in hyper-realistic, live-fire training scenarios
- Applied unsupervised deep learning approaches to longitudinal ICU data to discover novel sepsis sub-phenotypes

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees


Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.



### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales


Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
